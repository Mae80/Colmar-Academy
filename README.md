# Colmar-Academy
codecademy pro intensive capstone project

For the reviewer:

During this project I struggled with a few things:
1. I struggled with the header in the desktop version
2. In mobile view I couldn't get the images to stretch across the full width
3. I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong, but I couldn't change the dimensions(like padding etc.) for the button for both
    the desktop and mobile view.
    
  Thank you in advance for your review.
